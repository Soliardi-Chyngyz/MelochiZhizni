I completed my project according to the principle of Single Activity
All transitions between fragments are carried out by the navigation component
And transferring data between them via SafeArgs

Access to the application can only be after registration by phone number, I used Firebase Authorization for it

Under the directory section, implemented viewpager2 with fragments inside it

The administrator version is available on specific phone numbers:
-  so he can add new products
-  change
-  read QR-code
-  edit points
-  receive customer data

I used Firebase Cloud to store the database
